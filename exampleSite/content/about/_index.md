Hi, I'm Christopher Luis-Jorge. 

&nbsp;

I'm a Cuban-American amalgam based in Washington, DC who specializes in the playful, the irreverent, and the brief. My work has been featured in *The Dread Machine*, *Stoneboat Literary Journal*, and *The Acentos Review*. I've also previously worked as an Intern Editor for *The Florida Review*, Reader for *StoryQuarterly*, and Nonfiction Reader & Art Director for *The Cypress Dome*.  I've worked in the video games industry as a contracted writer doing both in-game content as well as writing Decks and Development Documents for internal use. I also have experience in film as a screenwriter and as a screenplay progammer for the esteemd Atlanta Film Festival and the stage writing and acting for teenie tiny theatre festivals in Orlando, Florida.

&nbsp;

I have over ten years of teaching experience, ranging from private tutoring to teaching English Composition at the university level.
