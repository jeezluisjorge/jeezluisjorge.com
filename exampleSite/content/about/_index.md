Hi, I'm Christopher Luis-Jorge.  

I'm a Cuban-American author based in Washington, DC who specializes in the playful, the irreverent, and the brief. My work has been featured in *The Dread Machine*, *Stoneboat Literary Journal*, and *The Acentos Review*. I've also previously worked as an Intern Editor for *The Florida Review*, Reader for *StoryQuarterly*, and Nonfiction Reader & Art Director for *The Cypress Dome*.  

<u>[Check out my fiction, personal essays, stage plays, and screenplays](/publications/).</u> They're great! I'm told they're pretty funny too.  

I graduated with an MFA from Rutgers University-Camden in January 2021. I have a BA in Theatre and a BA in English from the University of Central Florida.
