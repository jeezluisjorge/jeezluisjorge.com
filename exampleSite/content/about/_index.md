Hi, I'm Christopher Luis-Jorge. :wave:

I'm an emerging Cuban-American author based in Philadelphia who specializes in the playful, the irreverent, and the brief. My work has been featured Golden Walkman, The Acentos Review, and The Cypress Dome. Check out my fiction, personal essays, stage plays, and screenplays; they're great! I'm told most of them are pretty funny, too.

I'm currently wrapping up my MFA from Rutgers University-Camden and have a Bachelor's in Theatre from the University of Central Florida.
