Hi, I'm Christopher Luis-Jorge. :wave:

I'm an emerging Cuban-American author based in Philadelphia who specializes in the playful, the irreverent, and the brief. My work has been featured Golden Walkman, The Acentos Review, and The Cypress Dome. I write fiction, personal essays, stage plays, and screenplays.

I'm currently wrapping up my MFA from Rutgers University-Camden and have a Bachelor's in Theatre from the University of Central Florida.
