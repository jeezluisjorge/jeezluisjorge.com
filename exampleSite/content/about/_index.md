Hi, I'm Christopher Luis-Jorge.

I'm an emerging Cuban-American author based in Philadelphia who specializes in the playful, the irreverent, and the brief. My work has been featured Golden Walkman, The Acentos Review, and The Cypress Dome. I've also previously worked as an Intern Editor for The Florida Review, as Reader for StoryQuarterly, and Nonfiction Reader & Art Director for The Cypress Dome

Check out my fiction, personal essays, stage plays, and screenplays; they're great! I'm told most of them are pretty funny, too.

Currently, I'm wrapping up my MFA from Rutgers University-Camden, graduating January 2021. I have a BA in Theatre and a BA in English from the University of Central Florida.
